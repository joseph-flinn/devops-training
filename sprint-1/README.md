# Sprint 1

## Kanban

## git
Review some of the most prevelant git branching stategies 
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html). GitLab flow seems to be really 
well situated for DevOps; however, we do not need all of options it offers. For this training, 
we will be using GitHub flow. The `master` branch will be protected meaning that we will not 
be able to push/merge to it. The only way we can update it is through a Pull Request (PR).

## Linux Setup
Let's get setup with Linux for the coming weeks. We have a few options to consider to find what 
will work best for you. 

#### Raspberry Pi
Pros: you already have this and are somewhat familiar with it.
Cons: It is non-Intel (where the cloud is Intel based) and it _might_ have some interesting 
challenges with docker. 

#### Cloud-based
Pros: Gets you into cloud sooner
Cons: Starts your free 12-months and $300 credit sooner (might not be a bad thing?). 
Frontloading learning, possibly distracting.

#### Linux Laptop
I have a really cheap laptop from China that I am not using that I can let you borrow if you 
would like. It has an Intel CPU and 6GB of RAM. It is not super powerful, but a bit more 
powerful than the Raspberry Pi and it is a laptop that doesn't require an external monitor,
keyboard, or mouse. It could also provide you with a platform to mess around with installing
other Linux operating systems if you would like.

Pros: Getting really comfortable with Linux
Cons: It's currently in Portland with plans on being back around the last weekend of Feb.

#### WSL
You can enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on a Windows computer and install Ubuntu
in it. I would advise against running Docker in this, but it would work for everything else
that we are doing

Pros: use current hardware
Cons: Doesn't run Docker well
